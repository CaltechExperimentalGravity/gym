# Test Environments for Thermal control

Contains the python code to create simulations of the physical system as a gym environment on which RL algorithms can be trained and tested

## Available Envs
* `VacCan` env : simulation of thermal dynamics of the vacuum can considering the conduction through the foam and heating.

This environment can be installed using:

```
pip install -e .['VacCan-v0']
```
